Here's where the files for my Sonic Robot Blaster 2 personal projects are located.
These consist of random things I've done throughout my entire SRB2 coding joruney, and also consist of some long-term projects as well.
I tend to work on these when I have free time, or when I don't want to work on custom builds lol

### TIPS
***CLONING THIS REPOSITORY***
- Open your CMD Prompt, Powershell, or Terminal Emulator, and move to the directory where you want to clone the repository to by using the command ```cd <target directory>```.
- Clone this Github repository to your device by using ```git clone https://github.com/StarManiaKG/The-Story-of-the-StarManiaKG-Personal-SRB2-Projects.git (<optional name if you want that>)``` (If you can't use git, use ```winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget``` on Windows or ```sudo <package manager name> install git``` for Ubuntu-based Distrubutions).
- Finally, open the project's Github directory and switch to the unstable by using ```git branch unstable```.

***TO UPDATE THE REPOSITORY***
- Move to the project's Github folder, and use the command ```git pull```. (It may even require a password, and if so, enter it as you normally would).
- If you come across any errors doing so, use the command ```git stash```.

***TO PUSH A COMMIT/UPDATE ON THE MAIN REPOSITORY***
- Move to the project's Github folder, and use the command ```git add [(file(s) you want to add)]``` for specific files or  to add a file you want to commit or ```git add -A``` to add all of your changed files.
- Use the command ```git commit -m <custom commit message>``` to then upload your changed files to this Github.
- Then, lastly, use the command ```git push``` and input your github username and password, and the terminal will automatically do the work for you of uploading your nice changes onto here!
